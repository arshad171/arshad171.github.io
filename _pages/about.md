I am a PhD candidate at the Division of Networks and Systems Engineering (NSE), school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH. My thesis titled _Optimization and Learning in Edge Computing_ is supervised by [Prof. György Dán](https://www.kth.se/profile/gyuri) and [Prof. Vikoria Fodor](https://www.kth.se/profile/vjfodor).

My research focus lies in the interplay of contemporary machine learning algorithms and the classical optimization techniques in tackling latency-constrained service orchestration. I am interested in developing pragmatic solutions towards high performance computing to enable intelligent use-cases at the Edge.

Interests: Machine learning, applied optimization, queueing systems;

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
